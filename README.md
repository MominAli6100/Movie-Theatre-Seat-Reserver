# Movie-Theatre-Seat-Reserver
Code in java that uses files and a hashmap so that each user may have they're own account and have they're own reserved seats
Code needs 4 files, one for each theatre and a final database file that has all the accounts and they're passwords, look at the files labeled "A1"-"A3" for the theatre samples and the file called "userdb" for a sample of the database
Code will also write three new files after everything is done, these will be the new updated theatres labeled "A1Final"-"A3Final"
